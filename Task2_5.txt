Task 2: Summary of Our File's Role in Android
<FILL IN HERE 100 - 200 words>

Task 3: UML class diagram describing superclasses and interfaces is provided in a separate file. We have provided a SVG document, which shows the superclasses and interfaces. We generated it at www.plantuml.com. Task4.java shows the syntax used
to generate the UML. 

Task 4: UML class diagram describing non-inheritance associations involving other classes is provided in a separate file. We have provided a SVG document, which shows the Associations with arrows, but it is a bit crowded, due to the sheer number of associations. Thus, we have also provide a task 4.java file, showing the associations explicitly through plantuml notation. This UML was generated using www.plantuml.com. The arrows have been color coded to help with some visual clarity in the SVG file. Blue arrows are the associations for HostClipboardMonitor, green for ClipboardService, purple for ListenerInfo, orange for PerUserClipboard, and black for ClipboardImpl.

Task 5: What we have leared from this Code Review
While reviewing the clipboard service source code in the Android framework codebase, we have learnt how data is copied to the clipboard and placed in a new target location. This involves user profile management, synchronous thread execution, user permission management, and text handling for clipboard service. This has also helped us understand the Java programming principles of implementation of interface, nested classes, and function overriding.
