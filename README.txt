Excellence Justification:
-------------------------
While reviewing the clipboard service source code in the Android framework codebase, we have learned how data is copied to the clipboard and placed in a new target location. We have worked to understand the construct and the intent of the code. We have invested best possible efforts to understand user profile management, synchronous thread execution, user permission management, and text handling for clipboard service. It has been a balanced team effort to understand object oriented approach of Java programming, along with the understanding of a part of the technical domain involved with implementing the Android framework. Thus, we claim a top-notch excellence score for this task.
